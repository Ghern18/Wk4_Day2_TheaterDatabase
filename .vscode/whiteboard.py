#Examples:
#Input : 'Joel'
#output: 'JL'
#Input : 'Shoha'
#Output : 'Shh'

#In lecture we create our own Data base

#DDL - creating a column, this is the rules on how we structure our database, we can manipulate the info. Can change or delete in DML
#We will design our data base, 10 min. going over create and insert
# Designing database, from right or wrong, and see effects of it to deal with it

#Amazon mock and create, refer to it

#Videos are reference videos go and watch, 6 min. each.


#Enitity Relationship Diagrams and Databases.

#Difference btw SQL and NoSQL e.g. cigars
#each database had same object, shines through 
#SQL - relation between different things,  CAN'T LINK
    #you get user table, that has all info about the user. There is a favorits table, that you bring together.
    #
    #Companies have alot of powerful SQL databases

#ERD Table
    #Anything that has an entity is a table. Relationship very important. 

    #Primary Key - One unique identifyer that uniquley identifies and only one intance only.
    #Foreign Keys - are created any time and attribute to another entity in one to one or one to many relationship.
    #You want a foriegn key to point to a primary key.
    #It makes sure everything is well managed.
    #
    #Cardintality
    #Refers to the uniqueness, lack of repition in a database. SQL used to store alot of different info without having repition
